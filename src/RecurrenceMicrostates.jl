#           Abstract: The idea of this project is to create a standard library that
#   can be used in the application and development of Recurrence Microstates Theory
#   and its associated quantifiers. Here we try to generalize the computational process
#   so that it can be applied to any data situation, such as time series, images, or 
#   high-dimensional data.
